# California Housing Price Prediction

An end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict California housing prices using regression. This project is inspired by the Hands-On Machine Learning book and follows best practices for modular, production-ready ML code.

## Project Highlights

- Data ingestion from remote `.tgz` source
- Data preprocessing with Scikit-learn pipelines
- Train-test split, imputation, scaling, and encoding
- Model training using Linear Regression
- Model evaluation using RMSE and RÂ² score
- Artifacts saved using `joblib` (model and pipeline)
- Modular codebase for easy extension and deployment
